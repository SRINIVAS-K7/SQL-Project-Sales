# SQL-Project-Sales

Project Overview :

   This project involves analyzing a sales dataset using SQL to extract meaningful business insights. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL by writing queries 
   that solve real-world business problems related to sales, customers, products, and inventory.


Dataset Description :

   The dataset consists of multiple related tables typically found in a retail sales environment:

   Customers: Customer details such as customer_id, name, contact info, etc.

   Orders: Information on each order including order_id, customer_id, order_date, status, etc.

   Order_Items: Detailed line items of each order including product_id, quantity, price, etc.

   Products: Product catalog information such as product_id, product_name, category_id, brand_id, price, etc.

   Categories: Product categories.

   Brands: Brand details.

   Stocks: Inventory levels of products.

   Stores: Store locations and details.

   Staffs: Staff and sales representative details.

Objectives : 

   Performed data extraction and aggregation to understand sales performance.

   Analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

   Identify best-selling products and categories.

   Analyze sales trends over time.

   Understand inventory status and stock movement.

   Generate business insights to support decision-making.

SQL Topics Covered :

   Basic SELECT statements and filtering with WHERE clause.

   Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX).

   GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

   JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN).

   Subqueries and nested queries.

   Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.).

   CASE statements for conditional logic.

   Data manipulation with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

   Views and temporary tables.

   Complex queries combining multiple SQL concepts.

Sample Business Questions Answered : 

   What are the top 10 products by total sales revenue?

   Which customers have made the highest number of purchases?

   What is the monthly sales trend for the last year?

   Which product categories generate the most revenue?

   How is the inventory level for products across different stores?

   What is the average order value and how does it vary by store or staff?

   Identify sales representatives with the highest sales.

How to Run the Project : 

   Clone this repository to your local machine.

   Import the provided SQL scripts or CSV datasets into your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

   Run the SQL queries in the scripts folder step-by-step to explore the data and get insights.

   Modify or extend the queries as per your requirements.

Tools Used :

   SQL database engine (MySQL)

   SQL client (MySQL Workbench)


Conclusion :

   This SQL sales project provides a comprehensive overview of retail sales data analysis using SQL. It is designed for learners to build strong SQL querying skills and 
   to apply SQL for real-world business intelligence and reporting tasks.
